  <p>  As part of the quality controls on data retrieved from eSource, system and user controls
should be in place and appropriately documented to ensure all data collected from
eSource meet ALCOA+CCEA (attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate
plus complete, consistent, enduring, and available).
ALCOA+CCEA on eSource includes these elements:<br>
<li>Data are captured in the eSource in such a way that they are attributable. The
eSource system or device should capture information about who made the entry,
or from what other electronic source it was derived. To facilitate a secure and
auditable electronic system, security roles and user accounts should be created
for each individual given access to the system. It is up to the sponsor and/or
designated personnel to create and maintain these roles and accounts within the
system and validate they function as intended. The investigational site should be
properly trained and is responsible to ensure investigators and site employees
use unique access to the EDC system and do not share user account information
to avoid fraud or harm to any subjects. Sites should understand how the security
controls work.</li><br>
<li>Data are legible and in the appropriate language required by the local regulatory
authorities, and, where applicable, conform to industry data format standards
recognized and used by that regulatory authority, such as ODM, CDASH, CDISC
Controlled Terminology, or SDTM.</li><br>
<li>Data are contemporaneous so that it is known when the measurement or
observation was made and when it was recorded in the eSource. If there was a
time lag between the measurement and the time it was recorded in eSource, this
should be recorded in the eSource with the data, or detectable from the audit
trail. (See Principle 3: Capture data when first generated.)</li><br>
<li>For the data to be considered eSource, they should be originally recorded or
recorded as a certified copy in the system or device that is considered the
source. If the eSource is another system, such as an electronic health record, or
a device that captures data, adequate metadata to clearly identify the source
should be transmitted along with the data. (See Principle 3: Capture data when
first generated.)</li><br>
<li>To ensure data are accurate, there should be known quality controls on the
originating source, including validation of any processes, programs or systems</li><br></p>
